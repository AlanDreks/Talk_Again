program for people with speech impairment after a stroke

The program was created for people with speech disorders after a stroke.
The principle is based on teaching children the language. The path from simple to complex.
The first step: passing the test in alphabetical order and all syllables.
The second step: from letters and syllables that the test-taker can read and repeat without defects, the program composes words for repetition.
Third step: further from the list of words are removed those that a person cannot repeat.
Fourth step: "complex" letters and syllables are added to the "simple" syllables and words, "complex" words are formed from this material to increase complexity.

Example:

1. We pass testing. We set marks from 1 to 5 and find out what material we will include in the first lessons:
    # Score "5" - can read clearly
    # Rating "4" - can read with defects
    # Rated "3" - can repeat clearly after being read aloud by someone
    # Rated "2" - can repeat with defects after reading aloud by someone
    # Grade "1" - cannot repeat or when repeating, the student pronounces a different combination of letters


Assume that a student speaks fluently vowels (grades "5" and "4"): "у", "е", "ы", "а", "о", "э", "я", "и", "ю".
The student cannot repeat the consonants.

2. We repeat vowels and all possible combinations of vowels ("ау", "уа", "ае", "еа", "оа", "ао", "оэ", "эо", "яо" and so on ) to train the muscles of the tongue, lips and facial muscles.

3. Further, from vowels and consonants with grades "4" and "3", we compose words that contain 2 vowels and 1 consonant ("ага", "аба", "око", "ухо", "яма" and so one).

4. We pass testing every week and add material with a mark of "3" to the material with a mark of "5" and "4" to complicate the lessons.

5. After passing the test, the program automatically recompiles the material for study and maintains statistics by date.
